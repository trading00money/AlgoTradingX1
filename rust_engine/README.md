# Rust Engine — Ultra-Low Latency Compute (Future)

> **Status:** 🔮 Planned — Not yet implemented  
> **Current System:** Uses Python engines (`core/`) for all computation

## Purpose

This module is reserved for a future **Rust-based compute engine** to provide:
- Sub-microsecond order book processing
- Lock-free concurrent execution engine
- FPGA-compatible risk calculations
- Native memory-mapped data structures

## Structure

```
rust_engine/
└── src/
    ├── execution/   # Ultra-low latency order execution
    ├── orderbook/   # L3 order book management
    └── risk/        # Real-time risk calculations
```

## Current Alternative

All computation is fully handled by Python engines in `core/`:
- `core/execution_engine.py` — Order execution
- `core/order_manager.py` — Order book management
- `core/risk_manager.py` — Risk calculations

**No action required** — the Python engines are production-ready.
